# MineCraft Bedrock Server Updater
One Click Updater for Minecraft Bedrock Servers

## Usage
Simply place the proper executeable in the root folder of your server, and run it whenever you need to update your server. It will take care of the rest. (Only Windows is supported for now, but the source code should easily adapt for another OS)

## Advantages
* Very easy to use
* Very fast; exectues within seconds
* Retains all previous server information
* Very straight-forward, no extra features, perfect for those with existing servers who just need a way to update faster

## TODO (feel free to make a pull request)
* Mac and Linux support
* Maybe Auto Update?
